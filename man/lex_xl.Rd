\title{Parse Excel formulas into tokens}
\usage{
lex_xl(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Character vector of length 1, giving the formula.}
}
\value{
A data frame (a tibble, if you use the tidyverse) one row per token,
giving the token itself, its type (e.g.  \code{number}, or \code{error}), and its
level.
}
\description{
\code{lex_xl} takes an Excel formula and separates it into tokens.  It returns a
dataframe, one row per token, giving the token itself, its type (e.g.
\code{number}, or \code{error}), and its level.

The level is a number to show the depth of a token within nested function
calls.  The token \code{A2} in the formula \code{IF(A1=1,A2,MAX(A3,A4))} is at level 1.
Tokens \code{A3} and \code{A4} are at level 2.  The token \code{IF} is at level 0, which is
the outermost level.

The output isn't enough to enable computation or validation of formulas, but
it is enough to investigate the structure of formulas and spreadsheets.  It
has been tested on millions of formulas in the Enron corpus.
}
\details{
The different types of tokens are:
\itemize{
\item \code{ref} A cell reference/address e.g. \code{A1} or \code{$B2:C$14}.
\item \code{sheet}A sheet name, e.g. \code{Sheet1!} or \code{'My Sheet'!}.  If the sheet is
from a different file, then the file is included in this token -- usually
it has been normalized to the form \code{[0]}.
\item \code{name} A named range, or more properly a named formula.
\item \code{function} An Excel or user-defined function, e.g. \code{MAX} or
\code{_xll.MY_CUSTOM_FUNCTION}.  A complete list of official Excel functions is
available in the vector \code{\link{excel_functions}}.
\item \code{error} An error, e.g. \code{#N/A} or \code{#REF!}.
\item \code{bool} \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} -- note that there are also functions \code{TRUE()} and
\code{FALSE()}.
\item \code{number} All forms of numbers, e.g. \code{1}, \code{1.1}, \code{-1}, \code{1.2E3}.
\item \code{text} Strings inside double quotes, e.g. \code{"Hello, World!"}.
\item \code{operator} The usual infix operators, \code{+}, \code{-}, \code{*}, \code{/}, \code{^}, \code{<}, \code{<=},
\code{<>}, etc.  and also the range operator \code{:} when it is used with ranges
that aren't cell addresses, e.g. \code{INDEX(something):A1}. The union operator
\code{,} is the same symbol that is used to separate function arguments and
array columns, so it is only tagged \code{operator} when it is inside
parentheses that are not function parentheses or array curly braces (see
the examples).
\item \code{paren_open} An open parenthesis \code{(} indicating an increase in the level
of nesting, but not directly enclosing function arguments.
\item \code{paren_close} As \code{open}, but reducing the level of nesting.
\item \code{open_array} An open curly brace '\{' indicating the start of an array
of constants, and an increase in the level of nesting.
\item \code{close_array} As \code{open_array}, but ending the array of constants
\item \code{fun_open} An open parenthesis \code{(} immediately after a function name,
directly enclosing the function arguments.
\item \code{fun_close} As \code{fun_open} but immediately after the function
arguments.
\item \code{separator} A comma \code{,} separating function arguments or array
columns, or a semicolon \code{;} separating array rows.
\item \code{DDE} A call to a Dynamic Data Exchange server, usually normalized to
the form \code{[1]!'DDE_parameter=1'}, but the full form is
\code{'ABCD'|'EFGH'!'IJKL'}.
\item \code{space} Some old files haven't stripped formulas of meaningless
spaces. They are returned as \code{space} tokens so that the original formula
can always be reconstructed by concatenating all tokens.
\item \code{other} If you see this, then something has gone wrong -- please
report it at https://github.com/nacnudus/lexl/issues with a
reproducible example (e.g. using the reprex package).
}

Every part of the original formula is returned as a token, so the original
formula can be reconstructed by concatenating the tokens.  If that doesn't
work, please report it at https://github.com/nacnudus/lexl/issues with a
reproducible example (e.g. using the reprex package).

The XLParser project was a great help in creating the grammar.
